<h1 align="center">Fixmybrokenscreen Task 1 (Movie List)</h1>

### Project Description:

<p>This project is a responsive web page that displays a list of movies using data from a JSON file. The web page is designed to match the layout of the attached movies.psd file, with colors, fonts, page widths, and page paddings following the design. The page uses React on the front-end to render the UI components and Laravel on the back-end to retrieve and serve the movie data from a MySQL database. Bootstrap is used as the CSS framework to facilitate responsive design and layout.</p>

### Technologies Used:
<ul>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Laravel</li>
  <li>MySQL</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

### Features:
<ul>
  <li>Responsive design: The web page is designed to be responsive and work on multiple devices and screen sizes.</li>
  <li>Pagination: The page displays 10 results per page and includes links to navigate between pages.</li>
</ul>

### Challenges Faced:
<ul>
  <li>Integrating React, Laravel, and Bootstrap: Integrating React, Laravel, and Bootstrap required understanding how to set up a development environment that allows for seamless integration between the front-end and back-end, as well as how to use Bootstrap's classes and components to achieve the desired design.</li>
  <li>Creating the database schema: Creating the database schema required careful consideration of the data types and relationships between the tables.</li>
  <li>Implementing pagination: Implementing pagination required understanding how to use Laravel's built-in features for handling requests and responses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this project was a great opportunity to improve my full-stack web development skills and learn new technologies.</p>
